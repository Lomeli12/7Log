## Project Details:

7Log is a simple to use program that allows you to change the login screen background of your Windows 7. It installs the correct registry files, creates the necessary folders and sends your favorite .jpg images to become your login screen background. And if you want the original login back, its just a click away. It also contain "Login hacks" to futher customize your Login screen, which are just as easy to apply.

## System Requirements:

   1. Windows 7 Home Basic or higher(Windows 7 Starter will not work)
   2. About 8MB of Storage Space
   3. Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 or higher. Get it here: http://bit.ly/MicrosoftDotNet4
   4. Admin Privileges 
	
## Image Optimization:

To use Image Optimization, just complie 7Log, as it is already set up to use it. If something went wrong(which nothing should, but you never know) download the free trial DLL from http://www.imageoptimizer.net/Integration.aspx
They should have insturctions on how to use the DLL in VB.Net, which is pretty easy to translate into C# (especially since I already wrote it in the source ^_^)
